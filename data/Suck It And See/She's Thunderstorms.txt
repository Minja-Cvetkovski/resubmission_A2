She's thunderstorms, lying on her front
Up against the wall, she's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish, you should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet for

Acrobatic blood flow, concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms, lying on her front
Up against the wall, she's thunderstorms
Here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns, she's thunderstorms

She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of

Acrobatic blood, concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms, lying on her front
Up against the wall, she's thunderstorms

In an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms, lying on her front
Up against the wall, she's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms, thunderstorms
