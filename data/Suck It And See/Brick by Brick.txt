I wanna build you up brick by brick
I wanna break you down brick by brick
I’m gonna reconstruct brick by brick

Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

I wanna steal your soul brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll

Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

I wanna brick by brick, brick by brick
I wanna blow by blow, brick by brick
I want an episode brick by brick
I wanna brick by brick by brick by

Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Brick by brick (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
