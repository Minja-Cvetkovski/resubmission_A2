So up rolls a riot van and sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got a chase last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh, just for the laugh

And please just stop talkin' 'cause they won't find us if you do
Oh, those silly boys in blue
Well, they won't catch me and you

"Have you been drinking, son?
You don't look old enough to me"
"I'm sorry, officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be?
'Cause nobody told me"

And up rolls the riot van and these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in the riot van, and all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin
